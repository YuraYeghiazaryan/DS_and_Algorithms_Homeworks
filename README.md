# DS_and_Algorithms_Homeworks
Welcome to my repository for the Algorithms and Data Structures course at PicsArt Academy!
Here, you will find my solutions to various tasks given throughout the course. 
I have implemented these solutions using popular programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++. 
I hope that my code will serve as a helpful reference for others taking this course or those 
interested in algorithms and data structures in general.
